### Forks and/or Issues can be used to help out.

## This repo is where i will be tossing all the duds.
(Every scraper that doesnt seem to be working for me in my tests.)

## Yall can toss them into your scrubs addon to test run them.
(Some might still work but fail on my end. Check your settings but no need to make new settings to run em.)

## Yall can toss their base url into a browser to see if they work.
(Some are ditched due to their url being dead or blocked. Note that the block could be on another page like the search.)

## Yall can edit them however you want in order to make them work.
(Since i will be keeping the original versions on my harddrive its ok to tinker with them.)
